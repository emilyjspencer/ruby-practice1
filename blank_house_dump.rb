#I'm a client working for the Blank House. We want to display positive tweets about

#pretty much only receive negative press. Write me a program that filters out the 
#following words from tweets: "sucks", "bad", "hate", "foolish", and the most popular:
#"danger to society". Replace each negative word or phrase them with the word "CENSORED".
